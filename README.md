# Hord_method
  Chord method Reference point A. First, a chord (straight line segment) is constructed connecting the points of the graph of the function f(x) on the boundaries of the segment [a,b] (points A and B) and the intersection point of the chord with the x-axis is sought. Thus, the approximate value of the root of the equation is determined - point x0 and point A1 corresponding to it on the graph.
